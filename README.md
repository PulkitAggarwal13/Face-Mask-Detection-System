This is a Face Mask Detection System built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained to classify whether a person is wearing a mask or not, achieving an impressive accuracy of 93.25%. The system utilizes a custom dataset of images sourced from Kaggle to train the model for mask detection.

To enhance the model's performance, attention mechanisms—specifically Channel Attention and Spatial Attention—are incorporated into the architecture, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features in the images. The entire code is implemented using the PyTorch library.
